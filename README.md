# Predicting Medical Insurance Costs with KNIME

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the predictive potential of the **Medical Cost Personal Datasets** using the **KNIME Analytics Platform**. The dataset includes personal attributes such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status
- Geographic Region
- Insurance Charges (Target)

The goal was to uncover patterns and build a predictive model for estimating medical insurance costs, leveraging KNIME’s visual workflow environment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the relationship between personal attributes and insurance charges.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Build and evaluate predictive models.
- Visualize key findings using KNIME nodes.

## ⚙️ Workflow Structure

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Removed nulls and verified data types.
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., sex, smoker, region).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Age vs Charges
   - BMI and Smoking impact
   - Regional comparisons

3. **Predictive Modeling (attempted)**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree (setup stage)
   - Cross-validation (partial)

> ⚠️ Due to technical limitations within KNIME (including node compatibility issues), the predictive modeling was not fully completed, but the workflow structure and preparation stages are preserved for review and extension.
